# the Difference of learning between Chinese and English

When it comes to the difference of learning between Chinese and English , what popped into my mind is an image depicting that a teacher is forcing the students to repeat and follow the answers she has written on the blackboard in China while a Western teacher is encouraging his student to compose his own answers. However , in my opinion , Western methods render a relatively more useful way to learn.

These days have witnessed the obvious gap between Chinese and English concerning learning. From my perspective , it's mainly comprised of two aspects ,the first of which is methodology. Chinese students often do repeated exercise for long hours ,preferring individual learning instead of teamwork. Meanwhile , they learn passively and follow the teachers' guidance without much creative thinking and  practice of textbook knowledge. In the other aspects, the attitude towards study is to some extent various. Putting more emphasis on score and result instead of enjoying the process and taking the shortest way in the shortest time are some practical differences in their lives. Chinese students prefer to
follow the others and go with the flow instead of clear personal judge ,which is reflected on the phenomenon that they have an acute sense of competition and is obsessed with ranking.

The reasons for the educational differences between China and English-speaking countries can be attributed to several factors:
Firstly , Chinese culture values authority and attach importance to hard work and discipline . Secondly , Chinese education system , especially the university entrance exam system , has traditionally placed a strong emphasis on the academic achievement and scores , which can offer students a  more competitive atmosphere.  Last but not least,Chinese classrooms may favor a  approach centering teacher,  with students expected to absorb information passively.

Thus , in a conclusion , I prefer western learning patterns.








# Chinese vs. English Learning Styles

The contrast between Chinese and Western education is often symbolized by a Chinese teacher emphasizing memorization while a Western teacher promotes independent thinking. I believe the Western method is more conducive to effective learning.

The differences can be summarized in two main areas: methodology and attitude. Chinese students typically engage in long hours of repetitive exercises, focusing on individual study and passive learning. They prioritize grades over the learning experience itself, often seeking quick solutions and conforming to norms rather than developing personal judgment.

The roots of these differences lie in Chinese culture's reverence for authority and discipline, the emphasis on academic scores in the education system, and a teacher-centered classroom approach.

In conclusion, I favor the Western learning model for its encouragement of independent thought and active engagement in the learning process.
